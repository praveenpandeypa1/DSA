# There is the matrix question that we have to do is: Maximal area of histogram:
# There is same question from array that we have to do and it is related to find the area of histogram from givrn array elements:
# There is many more question where we have to work on more for solving the problem related to 2d array
## for row wise sorted matrix always use the concept of making a for loop and traverse the matrix from that side:


******************** Hence we are done with the matrix concept****************************

# today i solve the 20 most asked array question that are basic and can be asked in any coding competion.

#solved the problem realetd to best time to buy and sell stocks

# while solving the problem related to finding the subarray with unique element we will use concept of two pointer wih left and right pointer with lefyt and right increase on demand:
