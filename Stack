**** Representation of stack using Arrays:*****

## Stack consit of top, size, capacity variable:
## for push operation the condition of overflow will be if (top==size-1) here size is capacity of the given stack:
## for pop operation the condition of underflow will be if(top==-1) here thi i condition of underflow:
## the condition of checking weather the given stack is empty is if(top==-1) the given stack is empty
## for full if(top==size-1)

*****Representation of stack using Linkedlist******

## make a  node and take two values data and next;
 ## then make another class named as linked list and take top and initially point it to null"
## for push operation  the logic will be newNode->next=top;
top=newNode;

## for pop_operation make  a temprary variable named as temp of node type and point top to next(top=top->next)
and then delete temp;

## for peek retur top->data;

************Represenation of stack using queue*******************
We can reprent stack uing 2 queue concept and it is quite easy way of reprenation:

## we can reprent stack using 2 queues in the given data structure:***

## take 2 queues and push the value in q1 and then push all value in q2 untill q1 empty and then back push all value in q1 back:
## and pop operation is simple nand nothing extra requite it will:
